In order to look up your bin collection days, this Alexa skill requires access to your postcode. 
To allow it access, navigate to this skill in a browser or on your Alexa App, click Settings > Manage Account permissions, and ensure "Device Country and Postcode" is ticked.
To retrieve bin collection data from the Stroud Council website, the skill needs to send a request to the site with a UPRN (Unique Property Reference Number). The skill first retrieves a UPRN against your postcode using the [Ideal Postcodes](https://ideal-postcodes.co.uk/) resource, then stores your postcode and corresponding UPRN in a database for efficient future retrieval. Only the Alexa skill and the developer has access to this database and there is no other personal information (names, email addresses, telephone numbers etc.) stored here: just postcode and UPRN.
No other personal information is used or stored by this skill.
The postcode and UPRN stored in the database are not shared with anyone.
It is within your right to request the removal of your postcode and UPRN from this database if you wish.
